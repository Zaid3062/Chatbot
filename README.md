Got it! You need to document which LLM (Large Language Model) you used for your project in the README file. I'll help you draft a README section that includes the details of the LLM and other related information.

Here's a sample README section for your project:

# Project Title

[Brief description of the project]

## Overview

This project involves the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) from Hugging Face to perform tasks such as text extraction from PDFs, text embedding, and question answering. The core components of the project include text extraction, text splitting, embeddings, and a question-answering chain.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install langchain huggingface_hub pymupdf faiss-cpu
```

## Usage

### Extracting Text from PDF

The project uses `PyMuPDF` to extract text from PDF files. Here's a sample function to extract text:

```python
import fitz  # PyMuPDF

def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_path):
    document = fitz.open(pdf_path)
    text = ""
    for page_num in range(len(document)):
        page = document.load_page(page_num)
        text += page.get_text()
    return text
```

### Splitting Text

The extracted text is split into manageable chunks using `CharacterTextSplitter` from the `langchain.text_splitter` module.

### Embeddings

The project uses `HuggingFaceEmbeddings` from the `langchain.embeddings` module to convert text into embeddings, which are then stored in a FAISS vector store.

### Question Answering

For the question-answering component, the project uses the `load_qa_chain` function from the `langchain.chains.question_answering` module.

### Hugging Face Hub Integration

We use the `HuggingFaceHub` from the `langchain` module to interface with Hugging Face's models. Here is the LLM configuration used in the project:

```python
from langchain import HuggingFaceHub

# Set the Hugging Face API token
os.environ["HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_TOKEN"] = "YOUR_HUGGING_FACE_API_TOKEN"

# Load the model from Hugging Face Hub
llm = HuggingFaceHub(
    model_name="google/flan-t5-large",  # Example model name
    model_kwargs={"temperature": 0.5, "max_length": 512}
)
```

### Example Usage

Here is an example of how to use the above components in the project:

```python
from langchain.text_splitter import CharacterTextSplitter
from langchain.embeddings import HuggingFaceEmbeddings
from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain.chains.question_answering import load_qa_chain

# Extract text from PDF
text = extract_text_from_pdf("path_to_pdf.pdf")

# Split text
text_splitter = CharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100)
texts = text_splitter.split_text(text)

# Generate embeddings
embeddings = HuggingFaceEmbeddings(model_name="all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
vector_store = FAISS(embeddings.embed_documents(texts))

# Load QA chain
qa_chain = load_qa_chain(llm, vector_store)

# Ask a question
question = "What is the main topic of the document?"
answer = qa_chain.run(input_documents=texts, question=question)

print(answer)
```
